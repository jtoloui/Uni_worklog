      <h1>Week 1</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Running my first VM server</b></p>
      <p>I've never before university started my own server, so when I first ran the server it was all new to me and a bit tricky getting use to it, so when this lesson is over I might have another look at the server and try to learn a few more things about
        it so by this time next week I should be confident using it as I'm not use to the non GUI approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Doing the website awards</b>
        <p>
          Filling out those boxes about which site was my most innovating, most inspiring or most annoying was harder than I thought it might be as it had never really crossed my mind before, it wasn't something I normally think of in my mind, normally if i was
          on a site it would probably think yeah this site is fun or easier to use but i wouldn't think yeah this site is inspiring or this site is really innovating.

      <h1>Week 2</h1>
      <p>
        This week we began to use our VM server some more by creating a simple html file of a basic page then we used software to upload the files onto our server which i used FileZilla as i was using my mac. Once we has uploaded it to the server we then connected
        to it by using putty to run the website using the commands given to us and entering in the IP address that was displayed in putty.
      </p>

      <h1>Week 3</h1>
      <p class="scroll">
        In this week lecture and practical we looked at using CSS in html, so how to use it/ link the CSS sheet to a html file and what CSS can do in a website to make it look more professional and nicer rather than a plain website. We also looked a class selectors
        in CSS for example &lt;p class="test"&gt; hello &lt;/p&gt; the paragraph is in the class "test" and if i just wanted to edit that single paragraph in CSS all i would need to do is type .test{ text-align: center;} so this means i would change the
        properties for all the p tags in the html file.

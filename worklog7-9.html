      <h1>Week 7</h1>
      <p>
        This week I really enjoyed as we started to add in media tags into html such as &lt;video&gt; and &lt;img&gt; and how to made them available on multi browsers for example if some browsers didn't support that type of video or image you can add different
        file types in so the browser can choose which one to display and if it couldn't display any of them you could leave a message saying this browser doesn't support this file type.

      <h1>Week 8</h1>
      <p>
        During the lecture and practical session this week we focused on using SVG in html and what SVG is and the benefits of using it, I had never used a SVG file before and didn't know much about it so it was really useful learning about it. I think in the
        future as well i might consider using it rather than other formats, I also didn't know SVG can be edited just just a html file can.

      <h1>Week 9</h1>
      <p>
        In this week's practical session it was based on a website's design. So what makes a good site design, who is the target audience and what is the purpose of your site. We were given a list of websites which were all different designs and for different
        audience. Then we answered some questions about the sites we viewed.

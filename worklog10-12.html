      <h1>Week 10</h1>
      <p>
        In week was pretty interesting as we looked at the topic standards and what standards are, then in the practical session we focused on HTML5 standards for example the tags: &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; and also the layout of a html file:&lt;head&gt;,
        &lt;body&gt;, &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt;. We tested theses tags out in a website then we used CSS to customise the sites even more. Then once we were finished we went to <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">validator.w3.org</a>        to check to see if my html file was correct and had no errors, we also went to this site
        <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">
        jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator</a> to check our css file.

      <h1>Week 11</h1>
      <p>
        This week was really enjoyable as it was based on the tool Atom and the basic packages are recommended to install to make it easier to create a site. We also setup snippets to make shortcuts to setting up a HTML file. We were told to mess around and to
        get to know the editor so it would be easier to use in the future.

      <h1>Week 12</h1>
      <p>
        This week in our lecture we were shown a christmas greeting page being created from scratch and then in our lab session we were given the choice if we wanted to look and mess around with the lecture page code or we could start on creating our websites
        for our next assignment. I decided to start on our next assignment and begin to create my website, I managed to create the layout of all the pages and create a menu bar located at the top of the screen. For the menu bar I used W3School tutorial
        on how to create on with CSS but after creating it I saw that the menu was pushed all the way to the left of the screen and what I wanted was to have all the text and links centered so when the session ended I looked online to find some other
        tutorials which had a menu bar in the center of the screen.
